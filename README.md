# Effective_connectivity_eigenmodes
Example code for manuscript "Eigenmode decomposition of asymmetries in whole-brain effective connectivity reveals multiscale hierarchical dynamics"

This repository contains example code accompanying the manuscript. The codebase is organized into main scripts, utility scripts (utils), and functions, which together demonstrate the core analyses described in the paper. Example datasets are provided in the data/ folder. The code refers to Run 1 data, but the same code was applied to Run 2 data.

Additionally, the repository includes the cortical surface file
Schaefer_62Parcels_7Networks_order_FSLMNI152_2mm.nii.gz,
a clustered functional atlas in MNI152 FSL standard space. The corresponding region labels are listed in Table 1-1 of the manuscript.
